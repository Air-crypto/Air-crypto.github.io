            <li>Computer Vision Methods and Systems for Sign Language to Text/Speech, USPTO Application No. 17865379
                <p>This invention outlines a system that uses a low latency artificial intelligence inference model, that translates American Sign Language hand gestures into text. This technology addressed various challenges, starting with high fidelity gesture recognition, by removing the background image clutter in a live video stream. The gesture was then passed to an engine that created a wireframe based on the hand's landmark detection. This wireframe was then sent to a pre-trained YOLOv3 AI model, returning the inferred gesture as text. The entire process of recognizing gestures took under 32ms with an accuracy of over 99.71%.</p>
