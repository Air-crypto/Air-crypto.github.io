            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello, I'm Arihan Yadav. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering, with a concentration in Machine Learning and Data Science, and a double major in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My academic pursuits are enriched by a strong passion for both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of computer science and engineering. I aspire to become a full stack AI engineer, with expertise spanning electronic and computer hardware, GPU architectures, system software, and web design, all integrated within the realm of AI technology.</p>
            <p>My programming skills span across Java, C, C++, Python, Go, JavaScript, MATLAB, SQL, Assembly, and Verilog. These skills have been honed through both rigorous coursework and practical experience in various research and development projects. I have also worked with many frameworks such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Flask, AWS OpenSearch, GitHub, ROCm, CUDA, Docker, ROS, and MLIR. </p>

        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <h2>January 2024 - Present : Undergraduate Researcher at MIMRTL</h2>
        <p>Since January 2024, I have been actively involved as an undergraduate researcher at the <a href="https://mimrtl.radiology.wisc.edu/mimrtl-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Molecular Imaging / Magnetic Resonance Technology Lab</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research primarily involves performing model surgery on the LLaVA model to develop cross-modal machine learning applications. I also focus on running model training algorithms at the Center for High Throughput Computing, where I utilize 80GB A100 GPUs to effectively retrain LLMs (such as GPT4) on new datasets while preserving knowledge from previous data. Utilizing Docker, I containerize model dependencies to facilitate collaboration and ensure consistent environment setups among my team members. This role has been instrumental in advancing my skills in innovative machine learning solutions and contributing to the broader field of cross-model machine and transfer learning.</p>
