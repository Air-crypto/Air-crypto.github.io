        <p>Testing our guitar tuner - which was written in Verilog - on an FPGA board. Got it working at 4am.</p>
        <p>The image is one of my friends picking up Dominoes pizza at 2am :]</p>

        </div>
        <p>Solved for gradients and wrote the gradient descent from scratch for a binary least squares classifier.</p>
        <p>First image was when I forgot a negative sign which I found funny. Second image is the fully trained finished result.</p>

        <h2>Acoustic Keylogger for Password Thieving</h2>
        <p>My goal with this project was to figure out the security implications of acoustic keylogging â€” a technique where keystrokes are identified through the sound they produce. Keyboards emit unique acoustic signatures that can be captured and analyzed using frequency, timing, and amplitude analyses. By employing these methods, subtle variations in key sounds can be used to predict keystrokes.</p>

        <h2>Violence Detection in Videos</h2>
        <p>This project is centered around the development and application of a machine learning model using Bi-Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detecting violence in videos. As the internet becomes saturated with video content, there's a critical need for automated systems to identify violent content for reasons such as content moderation on social platforms, public safety, and mental health protection. The Bi-LSTM CNN model leverages CNNs for extracting spatial features and Bi-LSTM for capturing temporal dynamics, providing a robust framework for analyzing video sequences. The model, trained on the Real Life Violence Situations Dataset, achieved a validation accuracy of approximately 93.6%.</p>
